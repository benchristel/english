# Articles

The definite article (word for _the_) is __BLANK#DEF__. It comes before the noun, and causes the noun to mutate.

- __tree#DEF__ "the tree" &larr; __tree__ "tree"
- __boat#DEF__ "the boat"
- __people#DEF__ "the people" &larr; __people__ "people"
- __star#DEF__ "the star"
- __ghost#DEF__ "the ghost" &larr; __ghost__ "ghost"

When the first letter of the noun is __^m__ or __^b__, the definite article becomes __^ym__. The initial __^m__ of the noun does _not_ mutate in this caseâ€”this is an exception to the mutation rule described earlier.

- __curse#DEF__ "the curse"

There is no indefinite article corresponding to _a/an_ in __LANGNAME__.

- __tree__ "tree" or "a tree"
- __boat__ "boat" or "a boat"
