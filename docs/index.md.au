# A Grammar of the English language

English (or, in English, _Englic_ or _Englalic_) is a constructed language that
I've been working on since 2023. It's spoken by people who call themselves the _Englings_ or "descendants of angels", and live on the fictional island of _Englalond_ in the northern Atlantic ocean.

In this grammar, I describe, to the best of my ability, how to speak and write English. It is a work in progress and, probably contains many errors and omissions. All such mistakes are, of course, my own (whose else would they be?)
