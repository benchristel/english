# Appositives

An appositive construction is when two noun phrases next to each other refer to the same thing.
In __LANGNAME__, nouns in an appositive phrase must be joined by __be_1__ "being". As a modifier, __be_1__ is mutated to __be_1#LEN__ if, and only if, it immediately follows the noun it modifies.

__^Aragorn be_1#LEN king#CAP of_1#LEN ^Gondor__ "Aragorn, King of Gondor"

__neighbor#DEF#CAP 1SGPOSS#LEN be_1 ^Totoro__ "My neighbor Totoro"
