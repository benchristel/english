# Number

There are two main classes of nouns: _count nouns_ and _mass nouns_.

## Count Nouns

Most nouns are _count nouns_, which have singular and plural forms. The singular is the form found in the dictionary. To form the plural, suffix __<x-out>-ow<x-src>BLANK#PL</x-src></x-out>__.

- __<x-out>gwydh<x-src>tree</x-src></x-out>__ "tree" &rarr; __<x-out>gwydhow<x-src>tree#PL</x-src></x-out>__ "trees"

Often, the plural suffix causes the final consonant of the word to double (in writing).

- __<x-out>tarosvan<x-src>ghost</x-src></x-out>__ "ghost" &rarr; __<x-out>tarosvannow<x-src>ghost#PL</x-src></x-out>__ "ghosts"
- __<x-out>dweg<x-src>duck</x-src></x-out>__ "duck" &rarr; __<x-out>dweggow<x-src>duck#PL</x-src></x-out>__ "ducks"

Count nouns also have a collective form similar to the derivation _bag_ &rarr; _baggage_.
The collective is formed by suffixing __<x-out>-iod<x-src>BLANK#COLL</x-src></x-out>__.

- __<x-out>dwegiod<x-src>duck#COLL</x-src></x-out>__ "duckage"

Collective forms mean essentially "the set of all Xs (under discussion)". For the purposes of agreement, collective forms are singular. For example, you'd refer back to
a collective noun using a singular pronoun.

Collective nouns are used when talking about groups of things whose individuality
is not important, e.g. __<x-out>eleniod<x-src>star#COLL</x-src></x-out>__ "stars, as a group or phenomenon". They are also used when the number of things under discussion is
unknown, e.g. __<x-out>flentiod<x-src>child#COLL</x-src></x-out>__ "child(ren)", __<x-out>cafytiod<x-src>furnishing#COLL</x-src></x-out>__ "furniture".
The collective forms can be treated as mass nouns, e.g. __<x-out>theuliod<x-src>pebble#COLL</x-src></x-out>__ "gravel" from __<x-out>theul<x-src>pebble</x-src></x-out>__ "pebble".

## Mass Nouns

All mass nouns in __<x-out>English<x-src>LANGNAME</x-src></x-out>__ are formed from adjectives by adding the collective suffix discussed above.

- __<x-out>oethvil<x-src>monster</x-src></x-out> <x-out>onn<x-src>iron_0#LEN</x-src></x-out>__ "iron monster" (iron used as an adjective "made of iron")
- __<x-out>onniod<x-src>iron_0#COLL</x-src></x-out>__ "iron (as a material)"
