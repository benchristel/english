# Articles

The definite article (word for _the_) in __LANGNAME__ is __BLANK#DEF__, or **ym** before **p**, **b**, or **m**. It comes before the noun.

The definite article causes the word after it to undergo mutation. Mutation is a grammatical concept unique to
__LANGNAME__, but don't worryâ€”all it means is that the initial sound of the word changes.

The changes are as follows:

- **p** changes to **b**: __head__ "head" &rarr; __head#DEF__ "the head"
- **t** changes to **d**: __turn_1#GER__ "turn" &rarr; __turn_1#GER#DEF__ "the turn"
- **c** and **k** change to **g**: __house__ "house" &rarr; __house#DEF__ "the house"
- **b** changes to **m**: __ring__ "ring" &rarr; __ring#DEF__ "the ring"
- **d** changes to **dh**: __night__ "night" &rarr; __night#DEF__ "the night"
- **g** disappears and is represented by an apostrophe in writing: __tree__ "tree" &rarr; __tree#DEF__ "the tree"

If the initial sound of the word is anything else, it doesn't change:

- __curse__ "curse" &rarr; __curse#DEF__ "the curse"

There is no indefinite article corresponding to _a/an_ in __LANGNAME__.

- __tree__ "tree" or "a tree"
- __boat__ "boat" or "a boat"
