# Pronunciation

## Consonants

The consonant phonemes of English are as follows. Paired sounds are unvoiced/voiced pairs.

|         | Labial | Dental | Alveolar | Post-Alv.     | Gutteral |
| ------- | ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------- | ----- |
| Nasal   | m      |        | n        |               |       |
| Pre-Occ. | <sup>b</sup>m |  | <sup>d</sup>n
| Plosive | p b    |        | t d      |               | k g   |
| Spirant | f v    | θ ð    | s        | ʃ             | h     |
| Approx. | w      | l      | r        | j             | (w)   |

These are written with their IPA characters, except for the following:

- /θ/ is spelled __<x-out>th<x-src>^th</x-src></x-out>__.
- /ð/ is spelled __<x-out>dh<x-src>^dh</x-src></x-out>__.
- /ʃ/ is spelled __<x-out>sh<x-src>^sh</x-src></x-out>__.
- /j/ is spelled __<x-out>y<x-src>^y</x-src></x-out>__.

When not between two vowels, __<x-out>nn<x-src>^nn</x-src></x-out>__ and __<x-out>mm<x-src>^mm</x-src></x-out>__ represent pre-occluded _n_ and _m_. Between two vowels, the same spellings are usually pronounced /n/ and /m/ (some speakers may lengthen them to /n:/ and /m:/).

## Vowels

|      | Front | Central | Back |
| ---- | ----- | ------- | ---- |
| High | i     | ɪ       | u    |
| Mid  | e     | ɵ       | o    |   
| Low  |       | a       |      |

/ɪ/ is spelled __<x-out>y<x-src>^y</x-src></x-out>__, and /ɵ/ is spelled __<x-out>eu<x-src>^eu</x-src></x-out>__. The other vowels are spelled with their IPA characters.

## Diphthongs

Allowed diphthongs are __<x-out>ai<x-src>^ai</x-src></x-out>__ /aɪ/, __<x-out>au<x-src>^au</x-src></x-out>__ /aʊ/, and __<x-out>ae<x-src>^ae</x-src></x-out>__ /eɪ/. The combination __<x-out>ow<x-src>^ow</x-src></x-out>__ could also be viewed as a diphthong /oʊ/.

## Allophony

Word-final __<x-out>s<x-src>^s</x-src></x-out>__ becomes voiced [z] after a voiced plosive or fricative.

__<x-out>n<x-src>^n</x-src></x-out>__ becomes [ŋ] before /k/  or /g/.

## Stress

Stress is on the second-to-last syllable.
